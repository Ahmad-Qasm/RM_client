This folder contains the generic inputfield-component-
-factory: InputFieldFactory. Every inputfield that does
not need special functionality such as autocompletion
is "created" through this component by passing the inp-
ut field's id to it.

This folder also contains the inputfields requiring special
functionality. This includes the components:
*EngineSelector
    -TransferList
*Project
*Status
*BSWVersion
